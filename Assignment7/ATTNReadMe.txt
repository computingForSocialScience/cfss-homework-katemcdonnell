After 12+ hours trying to get the first step of part one to work I still can't get my computer to generate a playlist csv that I can use to populate a database. 

I moved on and tried to populate a database with a csv of a playlist a classmate was able to make. This still doesn't. I keep getting a syntax error and I tried to show it to other people to see if they could catch it and I was unable to figure it out. I tried rewriting everything and pasting it into a new file and still nothing.  I pushed the file and csv from me trying to populate my pymysql database - 'Test_db.py' and 'sample_playlist.py' 

I kept moving through the assignment as if things were working fine in hopes that I could at least get some points and not fail the assignment. I wrote the html files and tried to write in what I thought needed to be added in the app.py. Because all the above code doesn't work I couldn't test them and troubleshoot. 

I sought help from classmates, on piazza and in office hours but this is all I could accomplish.
